### Dataset Description
The data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. 
All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major
causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.

#### Conclusion
Given specific parameters, a model was developed to predict the severity of accidents, categorized as:
#### 1=normal 
#### 2=serious
#### 3=dangerous
Machine learning algorithms, logistic regression and decision tree, were employed for this task. 
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 91.67%.
Decision tree model achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 83.33%. 
These accuracies indicate the effectiveness of the models in predicting accident severity, with logistic regression outperforming the decision tree approach in this scenario
